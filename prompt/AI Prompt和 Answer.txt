Prompt:
Provide some papers related to evaluating the controversy level of judges' and audience's scoring in variety shows.
Answer:
Here are **some relevant academic papers and studies** that relate to evaluating **controversy, bias, disagreement, or quality** in scoring systems — especially where *judges and audiences differ or where scoring reliability is examined*. Even though direct work on *variety shows judges vs audience scoring controversy* is limited, there are **related quantitative and qualitative research directions** that can inform your methodology:

---

## 📊 **1. Judging Bias and Score Controversy in Competitions**

**Jeon & Park (2016)** – *Jury-Contestant Bipartite Competition Network*

> Jeon, G., & Park, J. (2016). *Jury-Contestant Bipartite Competition Network: Identifying Biased Scores and Their Impact on Network Structure Inference*. arXiv.
> This paper models judge scoring as a network and identifies biased scores, showing how even outliers notably impact overall structure inference — relevant to detecting controversial judge decisions. ([arXiv][1])

**Berthet (2024)** – *Improving MMA judging with consensus scoring*

> Berthet, V. (2024). *Improving MMA judging with consensus scoring: A statistical analysis of MMA bouts 2003–2023*. arXiv.
> Statistically compares different judging aggregation methods and discusses alignment with fan perspectives, which parallels judge vs audience scoring controversies. ([arXiv][2])

## 🧠 **2. Scoring Reliability and Bias Assessment**

**Luedeker & McGee (2022)** – Diving competition score study

> Luedeker, B., & McGee, M. (2022). *Relationship between judges’ scores and dive attributes from a video recording of a diving competition*. *PLoS ONE*, 17(8):e0273374.
> Analyzes the relationship between scoring and objective dive features, highlighting variability and potential quality discrepancies. ([PMC][3])

**Frontiers in Psychology (2024)** – Judge scoring quality analysis

> Cai, W., & Xiang, R. (2024). *Multifactor and multidimensional data quality analysis of judge scoring in diving competition*. *Frontiers in Psychology*.
> Examines scoring consistency and quality across judges — useful for statistical reliability measures. ([Frontiers][4])

**“Evaluating judge performance in sport”** – Rasch analysis of judges

> *Evaluating judge performance in sport* (2004). Uses Rasch models to analyze judge scoring patterns and detect inconsistencies.
> A classic approach to evaluate scoring reliability and bias quantitatively. ([PubMed][5])

---

## 📺 **3. Media & Audience Perspective on Scoring, Expertise, and Evaluation**

**Evaluation and expertise: Discourse of reality TV competition scores**

> *Evaluation and expertise: The discourse of reality television competition scores*. *Discourse, Context & Media* (2016).
> Discusses the evaluative language in TV competition judging — relevant for qualitative understanding of controversy between expert judges and public perception. ([科学直通车][6])

**Eurovision jury vs audience study**

> *Eurovision Song Contest: Can juries assess quality objectively?* (2025). *Central European Journal of Operations Research*.
> Explores alignment and discrepancy between expert juries and public votes in a televised competition context — directly relevant to audience vs expert scoring debates. ([Springer][7])

---

## 📌 **How These Can Help Your Research**

These papers provide:

* **Quantitative frameworks** to detect bias and controversial scores.
* **Statistical modeling techniques** (e.g., network models, Rasch analysis).
* **Comparative analysis** of expert vs public evaluations.
* **Qualitative insights** into how audiences and judges evaluate performance differently.
